I know, I know I've let you down
I've been fool to myself
I thought that I could
Live for no one else
But now
through all the hurt＆pain
It's time for me to respect
The ones you love
Mean more than anything
So with sadness in my heart
(I) feel the best thing
I could do
is end it all
and leave forever
what's done is done it
feels so bad
what once was happy now is sad
I'll never love again
My world is ending
I wish
that I could turn back time
Cos now the guilt is all mine
Can't live without
The trust from those you love
I know we can't forget the past
You can't forget love＆pride
Because of that,
It's kill in me inside
